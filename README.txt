OPERATION
----------
The 'bestsellers' file comes in two forms: the .csv file and the .xlsx file. Both are too large for GitHub to preview. It is best accessed by downloading the .xlsx file, but if one wishes to access the .csv file, it can still open in browser as raw data. Once downloaded, this file is best viewed in Google Sheets. If opened in Microsoft Excel, isbn-13 column will automatically transform into scientific notation. A word processing software is required to open the .docx document.
